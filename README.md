[![Anurag's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=ikoene)](https://github.com/ikoene)

I work as a software engineer at [Duke & Grace](https://www.dukeandgrace.com/), a full service digital agency located in Gent, Belgium.

My main tasks include:

* developing and maintaining web applications
* creating technical and functional analyses
* improving and expanding our internal "Harmony" web platform

I mainly develop web applications with the [Symfony framework](https://github.com/symfony/symfony). Iâ€™ve worked on projects both small and large in scope.

While PHP development is my expertise, I also have some experience with frontend development. I've used frontend frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation for developing responsive, mobile first projects.

I love experimenting with technologies that aren't necessarily needed to practice my day job. I have a fond interest in augmented reality and virtual assistants like Alexa.
